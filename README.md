The project is split into three main parts:

**1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data understanding
- Feature understanding
- Bivariate analysis: correlation matrix
- Bivariate analysis: pair plot

**2) Data Preprocessing**
- Dealing with outliers
- Train-Test split
- Dealing with missing values
- Feature engineering
- Handling text and categorical attributes
- Feature scaling and transformation

**3) Selecting and training ML models**
- Models evaluated: linear regression, decision tree, random forest.
- Models evaluated using cross validation technique.
- Models evaluated using TEST set.
